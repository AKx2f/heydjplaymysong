# Abstract
Hey DJ Play My Song (HDJPMS) is a music voting system web application. The intended audience of this product is for working professional Disc Jockeys (DJs) however it can be used by friends and family or even someone who plans to hire a DJ. It is a completely separate system from the actual device that is used to use to play the song.
Join the fun, place your playlist online for your friends and family to vote on! Where ever they are!


# Summary of Problems, Opportunity and Directives
HDJPMS’s goal is to do the same outcome task as other music voting system on the market and it is as followed:
* Ability to create a playlist with favorite songs.
* Ability to search a song and request it to be played.
* Ability to vote up or down on an already requested song.

However some of the current systems require the following before voting:
* A setup fee.
* Personal information such as name, address.
* Ownership of the songs which can be a legal issue.
* Direct connection to the music system being used to play the song which is a potential threat.

The risk assessment here is that with guest connected to the music systems with users which can be a potential cause the following depending on the value of the playlist to the DJ/host:
* Negligible.
* Slight loss of competitive advantage.
* Significant loss of competitive advantage.
* Significant financial loss.
* Significant business profit.
* Serious loss of life.

HDJPMS tackles the following ideal:
* Free to use.
* Complete anonymous voting system.
* Fast registration with email for verification only, no name or address needed.
* HDJPMS is an entity of its own, doesn’t connect directly to music system.
* This potential works well with legacy systems or closed systems.
* Peace of mind from malicious software.

With the user creating their own playlist, whether they are a DJ or hiring one for an event, this application can be used as a music database which can later on be used during the event for guest to vote on.

Potential directives would be to partner with a paid music record pool and be offered as an incentive for being part of that record pool.
